This code is based on the **Eliza library**, and it incorporates additional features like a **gRPC service** for managing agents. Below are the detailed steps to run the agent code and get it up and running:

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following installed and properly set up:

1. [Node.js \(version 20 or above\)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. [Yarn package manager (to handle dependencies)](https://yarnpkg.com/)


## 📖 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>First, ensure that your Node.js version is 20 or higher. You can check this by running `node -v`.

Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
yarn install
```

### Step 2: gRPC Service

- This code integrates a **gRPC service** to manage the agent. Ensure that your gRPC server is properly set up and configured as per the requirements in the project.

### Step 3: Build the Project

- If you want to build the project for production, run:
```bash
yarn build

```
- This command compiles the code into a production-ready version, optimizing it for better performance.

### Step 4: Start the Project

- To start the project in a production environment, use:
``` bash
yarn start

```
- This will start the agent code and the gRPC service, allowing the agent to function and be managed as expected.

### Additional Notes:
> - The project is built on top of the **Eliza library**, which is used for managing and interacting with the agent. Familiarize yourself with the library if you're planning to make any modifications or extend its functionality.
> - Make sure that all configurations and environment variables (such as database, gRPC endpoints, etc.) are correctly set in the `.env` file before running the project.
> - For debugging or logging issues, check the logs generated during `yarn dev` or `yarn start` to identify any potential errors or configuration issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the agent code and manage it using the integrated gRPC service.
